                Britton is a Chemical Engineering major who enjoys
                spending his time on dancing, school, and business. He
                enjoys hiking in the Alps, skiing on the Pacific, and
                climbing amongst the stars. After 3 years of dancing,
                he is happy to help the club by filling the Vice
                President position.

                Due to his passion for fantastic new horizons, Andrew
                majored in English and hopes to write books full-time
                someday. He has spent almost three years swing dancing
                and helps organize venues and events for the
                community. Reading and writing stories, attending
                church, and coding apps consumes what little of his
                time remains after dancing.

                Ariel found swing dancing through a Dawg Daze lesson
                her freshman year and never looked back! An art major
                with a Japanese and art history minor, she plans to
                graduate this spring. In addition to swing dancing,
                she also enjoys waltz, foxtrot, and occasionally blues
                dancing. She is a die-hard Whovian and Browncoat. When
                not with the Swing Kids, you can find her working with
                Eastside Stomp or Savoy Swing Club to get more people
                out on the dance floor!

                John mostly fills his time with dancing, eating,
                sleeping, and math. He has spent about two years
                dancing - the most recent year with Swing Kids. He
                also enjoys blues dancing and various eccentric dances
                he learned in high school. Other hobbies include
                magic, card flourishing, programming, solving rubiks
                cubes and unicycling.

                Taylor has been dancing in one form or another since
                she was little. Her dance life didnâ€™t truly begin
                until the day she saw that mezmerizing dance: the
                Lindy Hop. Since then she has been doing all in her
                power to dance every day she can, further her
                education through workshops, travel, and lessons, and
                spread the joy of Swing and Jazz wherever she can!
